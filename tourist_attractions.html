    <p>For anyone who loves to ski, Sandpoint is heaven. Home to it's own mountain ski resort, various snow sports run<br> 
        full-force come the wintertime. Of course, if the winter stays as warm as it's been, the season may already be<br> 
        drawing to a close..J.K. Maybe. <br>

    <h2>City Beach Park</h2>

    <p>A lovely stretch of sand, plunked alongside the water that surrounds downtown Sandpoint. According to local folklore,<br>
    the sand from City Beach wasn't naturally occuring- all the other beaches have pretty big rocks along their shore. So <br>
    some person or other had the idea to make it all a bit more... "people-friendly". Brought in dump truck loads of sand, <br>
    evened it out, slapped a park on it, and boom- happy SUMMER tourists, too! However, I tried to fact-check this one, and <br>
    came up empty-handed. So take it or leave it, lol</p><br>
